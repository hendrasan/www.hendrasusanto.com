## Project Overview

Allstars is a platform designed to connect influencers with brands looking for collaborations.

The platform has two separate apps, an influencer-facing dashboard and a client-facing dashboard, allowing for seamless interaction and collaboration between both parties.

In addition, there are several internal apps that are built to support the internal team, including a CRM dashboard used by sales team which is used to manage the process throughout the sales funnel.

## Objectives

Develop a responsive and user-friendly platform that allows influencers to find work opportunities and brands to discover and collaborate with influencers. Additionally, integrate with Midtrans API to facilitate payment processing for the platform.

## Features

- Influencer Dashboard: A dedicated dashboard for influencers to manage their profiles, view work opportunities, and track their collaborations with brands. The platform will periodically scrape the influencer's social media accounts to update their statistics to provide brands with accurate data.

- Client Dashboard: A separate dashboard for brands to manage their campaigns, view/search for influencers that match their criteria, and view reports on the performance of their campaigns.

- Mobile Apps: Both influencer and client dashboards are available as mobile apps, allowing users to access the platform either through a web browser or mobile apps.

- Internal Dashboard: A dedicated dashboard for the internal team to manage the platform, including user management, campaign management, and reporting.

- Sales CRM Dashboard: An internal dashboard separate from the app built for the sales team to manage the sales process, track leads, and monitor the performance of influencer campaigns. The dashboard can tap in to the Allstars assets to help the sales team to find the right influencers for their clients.
